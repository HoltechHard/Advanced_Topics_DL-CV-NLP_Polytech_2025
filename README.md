# Speciality Advanced Topics of DL, CV and NLP

### Main Goals of Course  
  
- The main purpose of the course is offer to the students of professional carreer **Интеллектуальные информационные системы и обработка данных** (Intelligent-information systems and data processing - 5130203/20101 and 20102), the capacity to have precise understanding about the theoretical/math fundamentals and technical-practical capabilities to implement models of the most known subfields of Artificial Intelligence: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Extraction and Agentic Systems.  
- The course will conclude with the composition of groups of 4 students which will make the integration of AI-models into real useful applications, developing Intelligent Systems and their benchmarks of model performance under 1 selected use-case with real data.

**Homework:**  
- Read the slides in the file conference-ai-06-09-2024.pdf and do some more research by your own about the topics covered in the week 01. 
- In a brief 1-page summary (in English pdf format), redact what you understood from the first class and select from the list of AI subfields described in slide #06, the topic which you think it's the most interesting for you and what previous knowledge and experience you have with this topic and expectations that you have related to what you will learn in our course.
- Define groups of 4 students and send the group list to leader of group. 
- Prepare 1 unique report (in PDF format) which compiles the summary of thematic *Historical Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: From Neural Networks until LLM* from perspective from each student.
